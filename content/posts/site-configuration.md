## Site generation

This blog is built with a static site generator called Hugo and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) servers.

Iâ€™m using a theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) with my own custom modifications such as a home page image banner.

## Site hosting and DNS configuration

My domain was purchased through [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and I manage my DNS configuration via them as well.

## Site editing

I write my posts in VSCode on Arch Linux, and push them to my personal website repository on GitHub, where they are automatically deployed via my settings on Netlify.

## *Note to computer scientists*

The site is built with an RSS feed at [https://www.isaachill.co.uk/posts/index.xml](https://www.isaachill.co.uk/posts/index.xml) so you can view my posts in an alternate format if you wish.

My favourite CLI viewer is Newsboat and GUI is Raven Reader.
