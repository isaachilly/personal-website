This blog is built with a static site generator called Hugo and is hosted on netlify servers.

Iâ€™m using a theme called Cactus.

My domain was purchased through namecheap.com and I utilize their DNS management as well.

I write my posts in VSCode (extension post coming soon), and push them to my personal website repository on GitHub, where they are automatically deployed by Netlify.
